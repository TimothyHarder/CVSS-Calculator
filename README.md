# CVSS-Calculator

The calculator works, just create a CVSS object and pass along the required metrics.

The format for the metrics can be found at the bottom of the main.py file.

There is a lot of cleanup needed for the readability of the math. I have been trying out a web IDE and there isn't as much linting as I am used to. 

This is not something I intend on supporting long-term, I just wanted to make it for fun, and so that I could understand the cvss calculation better.
